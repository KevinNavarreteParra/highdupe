# highdupe README

NOTE: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. I'M STILL LEARNING HOW TO MAKE A VS CODE EXTENSION. CURRENTLY, THIS EXTENSION DOESN'T WORK.

This is an attempt at creating a VSCode extension that fixes a common issue I have when writing. Often I'll write a word or a transition phrase more than once in a sentence or paragraph, which can be a bad habit--especially how I do it! This extension will hopefully highlight those duplicates while I'm writing so I can fix them without having to work as hard to look for them (because I often miss them when editing and revising).

## Features

This extension's main feature will be to highlight words that appear more than once inside one line of a LaTeX document.

## Requirements
